Hi, i'm trying to re-create with Flare a completely open source version (using the Liberated Pixel Cup asset, present on OpenGameArt.org) of Stardew valley... i have no idea if this idea will last or i'll get tired before, but I try XD

currently the hours, days and seasons are disabled... I will re-enable them in the farmer's house, as soon as the house will be complete, because if I add them now, then editing the map file with tiled map editor, something disappears

the version of the engine currently used is in this repo, for an easier download,
windows version only, for other versions: https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-game
