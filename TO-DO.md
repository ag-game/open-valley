* [DONE] remember how to edit the files to start the game (lol)
* [DONE] try to figure out if NPCs can move from point A to point B (years ago you couldn't)
* [DONE] finish changing original tilesheets to open versions

to be fixed:

* finish setting the tilesetsdefs for all maps
* change Joja Mart to Joy Mart
* set the sprites of the characters and for all the NPCs, and add them to the maps
* add a set of tool (axe, hoe, pick, etc) to the character to make him cut down trees, hoe, etc
* set the spawn of trees and all things that can be cut/broken, in the farm (trees, branches, trunks, grass, stones, boulders and other such things)
* try to make the setting medieval, or give the impression that the country where the game takes place is an old medieval village, without cars and asphalt roads
* stop and fix what you have done up to this point
