- NPCs will not have a favorite gift, but will have a series of gifts, among which they will choose their favorite, daily, based on their mood (therefore random)

- holidays will be as follows: summer solstice, autumn equinox, winter solstice, spring equinox, christmas, halloween (others to be defined) and all birthdays of all NPCs

- there will be a censored mode, where NPCs won't use bad language, and an uncensored one, where NPCs will behave like in the "[CP] Horny Girls of Stardew Valley" mod
