* subdivision of the maps into subfolders, to make everything simpler and cleaner
* added (basic) maps for each season

............................................

* deleted the folders with the seasonal maps... I will add them again when I have completed all the maps

............................................

* feb. 07, 2021 - update the main folder
* created a test npc, which moves and with which you can interact (not while moving). Flare allows you to create only static NPCs, so I had to adopt alternative solutions
* I am continuing to insert all the tiles of all the tilesets.... it's a big and tedious job, but it's progressing... in more I am adding also the tiles of the various animations, hand to hand that I find them

............................................

* feb. 12, 2021 - update the main folder
* changed the system that marks the hours (to be improved, currently does not work graphics due to a bug in the engine)
* the game now starts inside the farmer's house
* created the first teleport that leads to the farm (currently not the tilesetdef)
* when the time arrives at 12.30 am the character is teleported to his bed (and should trigger a new day, but I have not yet implemented for technical problems)

............................................

* feb. 13 2021 - update the main folder
* updated the file /map/farm.txt and the file /tilesetdef/spring_outdoor.txt

............................................

* feb. 15 2021 - update main folder
* add /soundfx and /map/parallax folder
* now the character can move on three maps (crossroads is not finished yet)
* update the TO-DO.md file

............................................

* I have updated the files to today's date: February 18, 2021
* I managed to get the time and the days of the week to work correctly (when starting the game the first day is NOT shown because I still have to finish setting the icons correctly)
* I uploaded a zipper file with flare and the game, so you only need to download the zipper file to try it, without having to download anything else (windows only) - the zipper file only weighs 29.1mb

............................................

* feb. 20 2021 - update main folder
* disabled all automatic saves: you only save when you go to sleep (even if it doesn't work perfectly)
* finished the map crossroad.txt and started the map forest.txt
* created the links between crossroad and forest and between forest and farm
* if you download the .7z file, you must replace the files in the OpenValley folder with those found here
* currently the days are bugged... I have to figure out what I did wrong

............................................

* feb. 22, 2021 - update mail folder
* fixed the days of the week bug and added dates and seasons (for now years will not be implemented)

............................................

* started again the creation of the maps, from scratch, using tilesets completely different from the originals. all to avoid copyright issues

............................................
