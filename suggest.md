- from ww user:
Would you consider to let the world continue even when the player is not playing

* from Ca Mille user: 
maybe a quest of needing the honey..for u to get the honey u need a boar..if the boar attacks you run to the nearest tree that have beehive and hide there to knock down the tree and pop! There's come the honey!!

* from me: 
create a sort of basement, under the farm-house to be used for cultivation even in winter, that the player will have to fill with fertile soil
